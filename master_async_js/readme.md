Synchronous - sync means one after another, until and unless one command is\
 completed the second command will not be executed.\

Asynchronous - async means start executing every commands at the same time,\
 whichever have completed it's execution give the output.\

task b - 2s\
task c - 15s\
task d - 1s

📝Note: to complete all the execution it will take only 15s.
